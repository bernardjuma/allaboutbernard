👋 Hi, I’m Bernard.

💞️ I work at Safaricom Limited as a Customer Service Executive.

💞️ My work is to offer high quality customer experience and customer support to all walk-in customers.

✨ Before joining Safaricom, I worked as a French teacher for a private school and an office assistant for about 5 years.

👀 I’m interested in Information Technology.

🌱 I’m currently learning Software Development.

💞️ I've worked in Safaricom for 8 years.

✨ I decided to take a class on Computer Programming so that I can venture into a new career of Software Development.

✨ This course will help me to diversify my career options.

✨ It will also help me to build my foundation on a career growth in IT since I have been having an interest in IT.
